# Lua-Love2D-Platformer-Physics
Simple 2D platformer physics in which the focus is to all be contained in one .lua
and have the bare necessities of a 2D platformer for simplicity and ease of use
so the user only has to include "require("SickPhysics")" and read the little bit of
documentation here to use quickly.
